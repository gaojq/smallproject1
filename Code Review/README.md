(Since you have 3 seperated python files, so I just made 2 UnitTests for your Twitter.py, and one for your Video.py, lol)<br><br>
1,The first UnitTest is to test the whole run time of your Twitter.py. If it runs more than 1e-12 seconds, you failed that test, so you
probably fail that test, lol.<br><br>
2,The second UnitTest is to calculate if you have successfully downloaded 21 photos, if you did, you passed it.<br><br>
3,The third UnitTest is to test if you successfully made that video.mp4, if you made it, you passed that test, otherwise you didn't.<br>
